## üìù Description

To view my portfolio, please visit [metcalf.dev](https://metcalf.dev).
This is a constantly updated and evolving portfolio, serving as an introduction to my work and progress in full stack development. This is written in **pure HTML5, CSS3 & vanilla JS**.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## üíæ Installation

If you are interested, feel free to clone this repo and use it for inspiration in your own portfolio. Though I doubt that is why you are here viewing this README. Thanks by the way for checking out my work!

## üì≤ Usage

Visitors to my site can view some select works from my portfolio; both the GitHub repositories and deployed sites. There is a short bio section to introduce myself. And finally there is a contact form to allow visitors to quickly send my an email without leaving the site. Additionally there are links to view my LinkedIn, GitHub and Twitter, or access me via email in their preferred method.
